# RP-Names

This plugin for **SCP: Secret Laboratory** adds an immersive, fully configurable system for assigning player character names upon spawning,  
as well as a `/scale` command to dynamically change player character size.

The plugin is built to work with the [EXILED framework](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED).
